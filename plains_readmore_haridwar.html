				</h3> 
				<p class="pp"> 
					One of the first places to visit in Haridwar is the holy ghat of Har Ki Pauri – which means Lord Shiva’s steps – located on the banks of the Ganga River. Interestingly, the Vedic literature mentions that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited this place, and you can also see a large footprint on a wall that is said to be of Lord Vishnu. Also known as Gangadwar, this is the place where the Ganga River first leaves the mountains and enters the plain.
					It is considered to be the most sacred ghat in the entire city where the mythological bird Garuda accidentally dropped Amrit (elixir), and it is believed that if you take a dip here, then all your sins get washed away. The Ganga aarti held at the ghat at dusk and dawn attracts devotees in large numbers.

Along with Hindu devotees, the ashram sees a high footfall of visitors looking for a peaceful site for meditation and yoga. The tranquil ambience of this place is so perfect for meditation that it even attracted the renowned seven sages, and thus got its name – sapt means seven and rishi means sage.
											As per mythology, Kashyapa, Vashishta, Atri, Vishwamitra, Jamadagi, Bharadwaja and Gautam – the seven sages were meditating along the banks but were getting disturbed by the sound created by the flowing river and thus captured it. Later, Ganga split the flow into seven streams (Sapt Sarovar) to minimise the noise of gushing water.
