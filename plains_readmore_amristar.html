				<h3 class="hh">GOLDEN TEMPLE
				</h3> 
				<p class="pp">You haven’t seen the soul of Amritsar until you’ve visited the Golden Temple – the holiest shrine of the Sikh 
					religion. Known to Sikhs as Harmandir Sahib or Darbar Sahib, the gurdwara is part of a larger complex. The Guru Granth Sahib
					 (holy book of Sikhs) is taken to the temple every morning and returned to the Akal Takht, also in the complex, at night. 
					<br><b>Note:</b> Make sure you remove your shoes on entry and bring a suitable head covering.</p><br>

					<h3 class="hh">JALLIANWALA BAGH
					</h3> 
					<p class="pp">On 13 April 1919, British troops, on General Dyer’s order, opened fire on a group of innocent Indians participating in a meeting at the Bagh, killing hundreds. As you walk the narrow passage leading to the Jallianwala Bagh, the first thing you’ll notice is an inscription on a stone plaque: “People were fired at from here.” This park is now a memorial for those who sacrificed their lives, with bullet holes marked for visitors to observe.</p>
					<br>

					<h3 class="hh">WAGAH BORDER CROSSING
					</h3> 
					<p class="pp">Wagah, known as the “Berlin Wall of Asia”, sits on the Grand Trunk Road, marking the dividing line between Pakistan and India. A retreat ceremony, the “lowering of the flags”, has taken place here every single evening since 1959 and is witnessed by hundreds of people every day on both sides of the border. It’s free to watch and starts 30 minutes before sunset. The Border Security Force (BSF) jawans (officers) encourage women and children to wave the national flag, run towards the gates and dance to lively Bollywood songs.</p><br>

					<h3 class="hh">MAHARAJA RANJIT SINGH MUSEUM
					</h3> 
					<p class="pp">Sitting within a beautiful garden known as the Ram Bagh, this museum was once the summer palace of the first king of the Sikh Empire, Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Today, the museum holds a fascinating exhibit of arms, armour, old coins and manuscripts – items that relate to the king – while the paintings lining the galleries highlight his court and camp, giving insight into the palace’s history.</p><br>


					<h3 class="hh">PARTITION MUSEUM
					</h3> 
					<p class="pp">Amritsar’s moving Partition Museum tells the story of the largest migration in human history. In 1947, the British divided the nation into two countries, India and Pakistan, displacing up to 20m people. More than a million people died from disease, massacres and famine, while many more lost everything they owned. The museum showcases newspaper clippings, photos and artefacts belonging to Partition survivors, along with stirring artwork and audiovisual stations that bring this torrid history to life.
</p><br>

<h3 class="hh">RAM TIRATH
</h3> 
<p class="pp">About 11km west of Amritsar is Ram Tirath, an ancient pilgrimage site associated with the period of Rāmāyana. It’s believed to be where Lord Rama and Sita’s twins, Luv and Kush, were born and where Valmiki wrote the epic Rāmāyana – the poet’s old hut is still on the grounds. This sacred site also features a well believed to have been dug by the Hindu god Hanuman, a devotee of Rama.</p><br>


<h3 class="hh">GOLDEN TEMPLE: 'LANGAR SEVA' IN IT'S MASSIVE KITCHEN!
</h3> 
<p class="pp">
	Guru Ka Langar is a tradition of serving langar, which was initiated by Guru Nanak Dev. The service has served the community in many ways. It teaches the etiquette of sitting and eating in a community, which has played a significant role in upholding the virtue of sameness of all human beings. You can also be a part of this humble service by helping in the kitchen (chop vegetables, wash dishes etc) or in the dining hall (serve food) of the holy Golden Temple.</p><br>
						
	<h3 class="hh">SHOOPPING: BUY COLORFUL SOUVENIRS
						</h3> 
						<p class="pp">In the vibrant bazaars of Amritsar and in every nook of its streets, you’ll find something worth buying. And shopping is the perfect for those who are thinking what to do in Amritsar. Don’t come back without buying the colourful and beautiful phulkari dupattas and a pair of gorgeous Punjabi juttis from Amritsar. This desi experience in the local bazaars of the city is among the most fun things to do in Amritsar.

							<br><b>Shopping places in Amritsar:</b> Hall Bazaar, Guru Bazaar, Katra Jaimal Singh Bazaar, Lahori Gate Market, Rani Ka Bagh, and Shastri Market are the most popular local markets where you can buy authentic styles and designs.</p><br>
