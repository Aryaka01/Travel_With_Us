															</p><br>

													<h3 class="hh">SAVOUR THE FOOD AT PARANTHE WALI GALI
													</h3> 
													<p class="pp">
														This narrow and famous street of Chandni Chowk, is home to some of the most lip-smacking paranthas, or fried bread. The recipes offered by some of the stalls are said to be generations old.
														The alleys are packed with customers at most times of the day, with the smell of oil and food filling the atmosphere all around.
														Different types of pastes and chutneys do the rounds with the main course. The din of the shopkeepers, calling for customers, fills the air as people jostle with each other to refill their plates for more and more of the delicious offerings.
														This can be quite a sight in itself even if you want to skip the oily stuffed Indian flat breads.</p><br>
