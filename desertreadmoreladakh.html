				<h3 class="hh">REVEAL IN THE BEAUTY OF PANGO TSO LAKE</h3> 
				<p class="pp"> 
					Remember the breathtakingly beautiful lake from 3 Idiots where Chatur lost it all? It’s the Pangong-Tso lake that traverses 
					through the international boundary that stretch from India to Bhutan. The lake offers awesome site for camping and is the 
					current hotspot for all people traveling to Ladakh. The rules do not allow boating on Pangong-Tso Lake but when the lake 
					freezes in the winters, if you’re feeling too brave, you might want to ice skate at just the bank of the lake.</p>
					<br>
					
					<h3 class="hh">THIKSEY MONASTRY</h3> 
				<p class="pp"> 
					This 12-storey complex hosts over 500 monks and is considered to be one of the most beautiful Buddhist monasteries in all of 
					Ladakh. For Ladakh sightseeing, Thiksey Gompa will enlighten you with knowledge about some of the Buddhist culture, lifestyle,
					 scriptures, statues and even paintings.</p><br>

					 <h3 class="hh">Take A TOUR OF THE ENCHANTING ZANSKAR VALLEY</h3> 
				<p class="pp"> 	
The large mountain ranges of Zanskar and Ladakh will be your companions through most of your trip to Ladakh. They may even be intimidating at times
. These huge mountains can make anyone feel small. However, the key is to enjoy the beauty that these mountains have to offer. The steep terrains
 covered with snow reflect the heavenly skies. The loud rivers rush through these mountains making for an absolutely beautiful combination of view 
 and sounds.</p><br>

 <h3 class="hh">DRIVE AT THE HIGHEST CIVILIAN MOTOR ROAD-KHARDUNG LA PASS</h3> 
 <p class="pp"> 
	It might not look like much of a road but it’s the best that there is. Managed by the Border Roads Organization, Khardung-la Pass is the 
	gateway to the north and can be considered by many as a tourist spot in itself. However, being at such a height, one has to take extreme care 
	of health while traveling through the pass.The place is a canvas colored with the blue-white skies, blue-green mountains with white tops, the 
	calm blue water of the lake and lush green pastures. Who needs any place better than this? The Tso Moriri lake is probably not as famous as the
	 Pangong Lake but it is still a must place to visit in Leh Ladakh for anyone taking a trip in this region. On the fun side, the numerous 
	 Tibetan flags that are said to ward off bad spirits and keep you safe set up a beautiful contrast with the white snow.</p><br>

	 <h3 class="hh">WHITE WATER RAFTING</h3> 
 <p class="pp">
	If you visit Ladakh in summers (which is the ideal time to visit this place) and wish to opt for an adrenaline-charged activity, then you must indulge in white-water rafting which is an extremely popular sport here.
	Also, the best time to visit this valley is between the months of June to September when there is no snow on the roads. Done on the Zanskar
	 River which is also known as the Grand Canyon of India, white water rafting is best enjoyed on a river with high cliffs.</p><br>
	 
	 <h3 class="hh">RELAX AND REJUVINATE BY THE STUNNING TSO MORIRI LAKE
	</h3> 
 <p class="pp">
	The place is a canvas colored with the blue-white skies, blue-green mountains with white tops, the calm blue water of the lake and lush green 
	pastures. Who needs any place better than this? The Tso Moriri lake is probably not as famous as the Pangong Lake but it is still a must place 
	to visit in Leh Ladakh for anyone taking a trip in this region.</p><br>

	<h3 class="hh">RELISH THE MOUTH WATERING LOCAL FOOD
	</h3> 
 <p class="pp">
	
	Leh is a multicuisine city serving Indian, Tibetan, Chinese and even Korean. The cuisine here exhibits tints of these foreign influences. 
	Visitors must try out the local dishes which almost define the cuisine here such as Thukpa, noodle soup;Tsampa, known in Ladakhi as Ngamphe 
	(roasted barley flour), and Skyu which is a heavy pasta dish with plenty of veggies as well as the very popular and delicious Momos which are 
	steamed dumplings stuffed with vegetables or meat. Drinks include Tea, coffee, beer and Chang which is an alcoholic beverage drunk especially 
	on festive occasions.</p><br>

	<h3 class="hh">WITNESS THE ANTI-GRAVITY AT MAGNETIC HILL
	</h3> 
 <p class="pp">
	The science behind the phenomenon is unknown but it has been observed that if you leave your vehicle at the base of the hill with the brakes 
	unlocked, it will start moving uphill slowly on its own. Magic? Definitely not. It’s simply the superpowers you get when you reach this place.
	</p><br>

	<h3 class="hh">TREK TO THE  DRANG DRUNG GLACIER  IN SURU VALLEY
	</h3>
	<p class="pp">
Ladakh is an ideal region for all mountainous adventure sports. The trek through Suru Valley to the Drang Drung glacier is one of the best in 
this aspect offering a mix of all the possible things one may do on the mountains. The trek is among one of the tough ones in the region and is 
only taken up by the experienced trekkers.If you an adventure enthusiast, you should definitely include visiting here in your top list of things
 to do in Leh Ladakh.</p><br>
